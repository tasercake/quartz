I'd like to be able to quickly share my Obsidian notes with friends.

[[Obsidian Publish]] is great, but I'm not sure I want to pay $8 a month when I don't expect any kind
of return on that investment.

Here's my requirements:

1. Host for free on a service like Vercel or GitHub Pages
2. Support Obsidian wiki links (like `[[this one]]`)
3. Host images, including SVGs export from the [[Excalidraw]] plugin

Some other stuff that would be nice to have:

1. Not require a build step to transform Obsidian MD files
2. Live on the same domain as my existing site
3. Support Excalidraw without having to export to SVG
